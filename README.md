### SchoolSystem.API
  * Welcome to the School API repository! This project aims to provide a customizable API solution for managing student information, class assignments, 
    grades, and other relevant features in a school setting. Developed with .NET 7 and utilizing a reliable data storage solution like SQL Server, the School API 
    enables seamless integration and efficient management of students, classes, assignments, and grading components.

### Key Features:
  * Flexible API Endpoints: The API offers a range of endpoints to create, update, delete.
  * Structured Data Storage: The FAQ data is stored in a SQL Server database, ensuring scalability, reliability, and easy maintenance.
  * CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The API includes CORS support, allowing client applications to access the API from different domains.
  * AutoMapper: The API integrates AutoMapper, simplifying the mapping between different data models within the application.
  * Fluent Validation: The API employs the Fluent Validation library to define and enforce validation rules for incoming data. 
  * Dependency Injection: The project utilizes the built-in dependency injection feature of .NET, facilitating the management and injection of dependencies.
  * Secure Authentication: You can implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to control access to the API endpoints and protect 
    sensitive data.
  * MediatR: The API utilizes the MediatR library to implement the Mediator pattern, enabling decoupling of requests and handlers.
